# Creating an Analyzer

Firstly, thank you for your interest in creating an Analyzer!

These are the steps to get going:

1. Check [our repository list for an existing `...-analyzer`](https://github.com/exercism?q=analyzer) to ensure that one doesn't already exist.
2. Scan the [contents of the `docs` folder](./) to ensure you are comfortable with the idea of creating an analyzer.
3. [Open an issue](https://github.com/exercism/automated-mentoring-support/issues/new?template=new-analyzer.md) according to the template. (See [the C# issue](https://github.com/exercism/automated-mentoring-support/issues/8) for example)

If we agree to start that analyzer, your first steps will then be:

4. Create a boilerplate codebase that conforms to [The Analyzer Interface](./interface.md).
5. Open an issue in this repository requesting a `two-fer` dataset to work from.
6. Create an analyzer for the `two-fer` exercises that approves the optimal solution(s).
7. Create an issue in **this** repository with details regarding how your code needs to be deployed.

We have an incredibly friendly and supportive community who will be happy to help you as you work through this! Just create new issues in this repository as needed :)
