# Feedback guidelines

The goal of a language track on Exercism is to give people a way to achieve a
high level of fluency at a low level of proficiency. We're aiming for fluency
in the syntax, idioms, and the standard library of the language. You can read
more about the [goal of exercism here](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/about/goal-of-exercism.md).

## Definitions

In the following paragraphs, keywords such as **MUST**, **SHOULD**, **COULD**
are to be interpreted as in [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt);
given that we recognise the following four output states and their restrictions:

- `approve_as_optimal`: **COULD** be a best solution, **SHOULD** be without comment
- `approve_with_comment`: **COULD** be a best solution, **MUST** be with comment
- `disapprove_with_comment`: **MUST** be with comment
- `refer_to_mentor`: **COULD** be with comment

## Conditions and outcome

For feedback generated by automated mentoring:

- it **SHOULD** `disapprove_with_comment` when someone isn't using one of the
  subjects the exercise is supposed to teach,
- each `disapprove_with_comment` **MUST** have at least one comment,
- each `disapprove_with_comment` **SHOULD** steer a student towards an `approve_`,
- a student **SHOULD NOT** get a `refer_to_mentor` in a newer iteration, if they've
  had a `disapprove_with_comment` in a previous iteration,
- a `refer_to_mentor` **COULD** have one or more comments which will be given to
  the mentor.

There is no minimum or maximum amount of :speech_balloon: comments. However, each
comment **SHOULD** be aiding the student towards an approvable solution.

## Approvability

Given the above, and to re-iterate that we focus on language fluency:

### Incorrect Naming or Casing

In general, if it's a _language feature_ that will be caught by a compiler or parser
or based on official rules (which means there is a dependency on correctness in
tools), you should `disapprove_with_comment`, preferably linking to the official
rules. If it's a _stylistic_ choice, or there are _competing standards_, do not
remark at all.

> - :-1: dissapprove if there are official *strict* guidelines on naming conventions
> - :+1: approve if there are only _defacto_ standard(s) and everything else is fine.
> - :speech_balloon: leave a comment if there is something noteworthy
> - :no_bell: ignore stylistic issues if it's not integral to the language

#### Examples

- **Ruby** has a language feature where `_` is treated differently,
  - :-1: If a student uses `_` for a variable name, but then uses it.
- **Ruby** recognises `constants` only if they start with a **C**apital Letter,
  - :-1: If a student uses `snake_case` for a `class` name
- **Ruby** has _defacto_ standards on `cAsInG` and `name-ing`,
  - :no_bell: If a student uses `camelCase` for a variable, leave it be.
  - :speech_balloon: You may guide students that `snake_case` is to be expected by
    most IDEs and highlighting on exercism in code blocks for variables.
- **JavaScript** IDEs highlight variables which are not used, except for those
  prefixed with an underscore (`_`).
  - :speech_balloon: Note that this behaviour exist so it might help them to use a
    different naming strategy. They might think that prefixing with `_` means 
    `private`, which is not the case in JavaScript.
- **TypeScript** has a _defacto_ standard lint tool provided by Palantir,
  - :no_bell: If a student does not follow these rules as the lint tool is not 
    official. In fact, there are multiple linters out there, with mutually exclusive
    rules.
- **Go** has very strict rules around naming and other linting.
  - :-1: If the student does not follow these rules (e.g. has not applied `gofmt`)

### Badly formatted code

The same rules apply as above. In general, if `linting` and a specific format is not
part of the official language, and/or not integral to the language:
- :no_bell: **SHOULD NOT** disapprove on it
- :speech_balloon: You may guide students towards tools for auto-formatting

# Running guidelines

Each solution gets 100% machine resources for a ten second window.

## Maximum runtime

After 10 seconds, the process is halted and reports as a time-out.
